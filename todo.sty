+Week 1
    Create a summary statistics table
    Write up methods section
+Week 2
    Run multivariable models, putting all the data together and test if each factor (#comments, #views, video length, video age) is an independently significant predictor of the outcome (LTV ratio?)
    Write up background section
+Week 3
    Rerun the analysis using the final, compiled data
    Write up results section 
+Week 4
    Write up discussion section
